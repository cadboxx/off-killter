# Off-Killter

> A WebVR game built with A-Frame.

## Gameplay Synopsis

Playing as a QA tester at Killter Innovations, your job is to spot defects in newly manufactured robots. You have to make three recordings that the new robots will playback to verify their functionality as they roll off the assembly line. Once you start the factory you can observe the assembly line from the control panel. If you see a defective robot you must move the crane over it and press the big red button to select it.

#### Controls

* Use the left motion controller and touchpad to teleport.
* Use the right motion controller touchpad to rotate the camera.
  * Try to keep facing forward and rotate by only using hand controls
* Use the right trigger to select UI buttons.

#### Tips and Known Issues

* Currently only tested in Firefox using the HTC Vive.
* Currently the game works best if you are always facing forward (with the exception of recording) and use the motion controllers for camera rotation and navigation.
* Manual physics are a little funky.
* If you're not standing in the middle of your play space while recording, the crane might not recognize the avatar you have selected.
* Poor optimization might = bad FPS which might = fast forwarded/slowed down replays/recordings.
* I am actively working on optimizing the scene and refactoring the code.
