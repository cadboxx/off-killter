# Off-Killter
A VR game relying on good memory and quick reactions.

Your movement will be mirrored back to you in real time. Make a few recordings that capture your headset and motion controller positions. You can watch these recordings back as many times as you want. When you're ready to start, the game will spawn ghosts to play all the recordings back at once; but something isn't quite right. Can you spot the imposter before he makes a dash for it?
