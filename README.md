# Off-Killter

> A VR game prototype that records, replays, and mutates player movements using the headset and motion controllers.

## Gameplay Synopsis

As soon as you enter VR your movement input will be mirrored back to you in real time by the onscreen avatar. Click the record button to capture three recordings that track your headset and motion controller positions. Make sure to move enough so that the recording is saved!

You can watch these recordings back as many times as you want to memorize them. Be aware that while the onscreen avatar is mirrored back to you in real time, your recordings are not.

When you're ready to start, the game will spawn avatars to play all the recordings three times each; but one of the replays has been mutated. Spot the mutated recording before playback finishes to win! The harder the difficulty the harder it is to spot the mutation.

When the game is over you can see what body parts were mutated, at what point the mutation started, and along what axes the mutations were applied. Start a new round to replay the same recordings with a new mutation or restart the game to record new ones!
